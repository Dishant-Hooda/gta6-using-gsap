# GTS 6 Website (Fan Project)

This project is a fan-made website for the fictional "GTS 6" video game. It was created as a practice exercise for learning and implementing animations and effects using the GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP).

**Please note:** This is **not** the official website for any Grand Theft Auto game or Rockstar Games.

**Inspiration:** The animations and effects implemented in this project draw inspiration from the visually engaging websites and learning resources provided by **Sheryians Coding School**.

## Built With

* **React.js:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **Vite:** A build tool that provides a fast and lean development experience for modern web projects.
* **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
* **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform):** A powerful JavaScript library for creating high-performance animations.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project was to:

* Practice and explore the capabilities of GSAP for creating various animations and effects.
* Gain experience integrating GSAP with a React.js and Tailwind CSS project.
* Develop a visually engaging and interactive website based on the theme of a hypothetical "GTS 6" game.

## Features (Implemented for Practice)

While this is not a fully functional website, it may showcase some of the following animation and effect techniques implemented using GSAP:

* Page transitions
* Parallax scrolling effects
* Interactive elements with hover or click animations
* Text reveal animations
* Loading animations

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <rhttps://github.com/Dishant-Hooda/gta6-using-gsap.git>
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd your-project-directory
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```

4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    ```

    This will start the Vite development server, and you should be able to view the website in your browser (usually at `http://localhost:5173`).

## Further Development (Optional)

This project can be further expanded upon by:

* Adding more complex and sophisticated GSAP animations.
* Implementing additional sections and content.
* Exploring more advanced React.js concepts.
* Refining the styling and responsiveness with Tailwind CSS.
